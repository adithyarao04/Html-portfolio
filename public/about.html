<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Adithya Rao – a passionate full stack web developer on a mission to build high-impact digital solutions that solve real-world problems
  . With a deep love for both logic and aesthetics, I craft seamless user experiences backed by robust backend architectures.</p>

<p>My journey began with curiosity and a keyboard, but has evolved into a commitment to writing clean, scalable, and production-ready code across the entire stack –
   from responsive frontend interfaces (React, Next.js, Tailwind) to powerful backend APIs (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
   I thrive in fast-paced environments, adapt quickly, and constantly level up through hands-on projects, open-source contributions, and staying plugged into tech trends. .</p>

<p>My goal? To join a visionary team where I can contribute meaningfully, solve complex challenges, and grow into a lead developer. I'm preparing to earn it by delivering 10x value. Let’s build the future, one line of code at a time.</p>
